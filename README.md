# Broken-Dreams
This Game was created in the course of Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1.
We worked on this in a Team of five:
- Rohe Steffen
- Maier Jonas
- Holzapfel Johannes
- Winkeler Julius
- Burkhardt Peter (ME)

In this game you have to get little Dream-Susi back into her bed. 
The Problem is that Susis Dream-World is broken apart.
You have to get through little Riddles and JumpÂ´n Runs to get to little cranks to toe her broken room back together.
